The owner of a Boarding House has ten rooms to be rented by students (each room identified by a number from 0 to 10).

Write a program that initializes all rooms as if they are empty and then read a number (N) representing the amount of
students that will rent the rooms (N can be any number from 1 to 10). Then, register the rent from all students. For
each rent registry, inform the student's name and email as well as the desired room number. Always assume the desired
room to be empty. At the end, your program should print a report from all rooms of the boarding house, by room order, as
the following example:
